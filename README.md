# Welcome to my modifikation of uikit

Its a simplefyed version wich you can use together with as an example bootstrap. No js Framework needed.
Mostly I added some SVGs I use in my projects. I do not currently provide docs to what I changed. For the rest please look in the [official Docs](https://getuikit.com/docs/introduction)

##License
This project is under the same license then the Original. But please note that some of my added svgs are not included in this license and are not be allowed to be used in your project. This Icons will be clarefied with a comment in the code.
